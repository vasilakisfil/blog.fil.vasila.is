I am just a software engineer who loves crafting web services.

Worked mostly with Ruby and Javascript, but familiar with C/Go/Java/C++ as well. REST APIs specialist.
Optimizing services for low latency and high throughput is my thing. Pure interest in networks and services.

Experienced with remote working.
